# pwvucontrol

## General info

This is the old development branch using only pipewire-rs bindings for introspecting/controlling pipewire.

It is a more low-level API which means you have to do your own object tracking. pipewire-rs was also lacking several things which is why work was started on migrating to wireplumber-rs for the API.
